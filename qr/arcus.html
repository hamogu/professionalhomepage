  <p>
    Basic design for ARCUS, showing a ray-trace for an on-axis point
    source with a monochromatic emission at 0.5 keV = 24.8 Angstrom.
    ARCUS has four channels
    positioned in two pairs. Each pair of
    channels shares an optical axis.
    The two optical axes are shown here as thin blue
    cylinders.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rays start in the aperture, which consists of four rectangles
    located above the SPO channels. Each channel has a number of SPO
    modules, shown in green.
    The modules have different dimensions depending on their distance
    from their respective optical axis.
    Photons bounce of their mirrors twice in a Wolter type I like
    geometry. However, in this simulation the SPOs are somewhat
    simplified such that the
    reflection actually happens in a single plane, shown in white.
    Rays are imaged onto detectors (yellow).
  </p>

  <p>
    A closer look at the detectors shows that several
    grating orders are detected at the same time.
